              	<h2 class="hr">Overview</h2>
                <p>Volleyball is a team sport played with one ball and a middle net. One team try to hit the ball over the net, land it on the opponent's court. Another team must send the ball back over the net within 3 tries, without letting it touch the ground. A player is not allowed to hit the ball twice consecutively except when attempting a block. </p>

                <p>The ball is put into the play when the right back-row player serve it to the other team. The game keeps going until the ball touches the ground, or goes out the court, or a team fails to return it to other side, or commits a fault.</p>

                <h4 class="hr">When to get a point?</h4>
                <p>The team winning a rally scores a point. When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise.<p>

                <h4 class="hr">Who is the winner?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The best of three or best of five games will win matches. </li>
                        <li>In a non-deciding game, the team first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage.</li>
